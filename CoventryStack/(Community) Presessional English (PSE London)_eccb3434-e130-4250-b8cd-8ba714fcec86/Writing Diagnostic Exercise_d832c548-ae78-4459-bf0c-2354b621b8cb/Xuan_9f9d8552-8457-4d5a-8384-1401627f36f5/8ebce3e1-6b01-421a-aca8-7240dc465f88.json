        "value": "<p>The aim of this report is to discuss the two mainly transportation that students choosing to go to the university, which is by Bike and Train.</p><p>The most students choose to go to school by bike. There are three reasons support this choice. The first reason is that it is good for environment, based on safe the pollution. The second reason is bike is benefits for healthy, and the last reason on it is cheap. However, there also have some negative affects about bike, like it is not safe, and the speed is slowly than other vehicle, furthermore, people may meet many dust when they biking outside, so they need to change their clothes when they finishing biking.</p><p>The second popular way to go to university is train. It also include three merits and weaknesses. For merits, train is good for environment like bike do, and it even quickly, the more benefits is train station always near the university, so it is convenient for students.Now, transfer to the negative view, the ticket of train is expensive for students, and it is has no guarantee. The train always late for station or it may cancel suddenly without notices in advance. In addition, the train will be very crowed in peak time.</p><p>Finally, I have some suggestions for university. To bike, I take a view the university should enact safe bikes lane for students to avoid traffic accident. Another important point is changing rooms for students to safe the commute time. To train, I hope university can delay the time of lessons, then students could get to school avoid peak time.</p><br>",
