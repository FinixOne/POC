        "value": "<p>The aim of this report is to addess two most popular means of transportation used by students. Two of the most popular options for students are bicycles and trains. The benefits and drawbacks of both travel options are reviewed in this report. This essay will offer some recommendations to university for solving the problems caused by the disadvantages that students faced.<br><br></p><p>Bike is the most popular transportation for students because biking is an inexpensive way to traveling to university and it is also like exercising while riding. Therefore, it is good for your health. Cycling so much help the environment because it does not generate any pollutions. However, the disadvantage of cycling to college for students is they might spending a lot of time on the road. Because of the heat and dust, they had to change my clothes for class. One of the disadvantages of cycling is safety.</p><p><br></p><p>Second most popular transport is train. The benefits of train is they are environmentally friendly because many people can travel on one trip, save traveling time and it is convenient because there is a station close by university. On the other hand, traveling by train has some disadvantages. It is costly and some students may be unable to afford it, and some occasion the train had been late and it is very crowded during rush hour.</p><p><br></p><p>In my opinion, university should have facilities for students who travel of all types. For example students who travel by bicycle there should be a proper bicycle storage facility. There is a cycling lanes for safety. The changing room should be provided for students. Meanwhile, the students who use the train to travel that late because of train problems in rush period. The university should start lesson avoid rush hour can solving the issue. One of <!--StartFragment-->drawbacks that students faced to is the ticket are expensive. In my point of view, the university should have students travel ticket for help their students.<br></p>",
