Transportations have many reasons that people like to use them and have there own advantages and disadvantages that tell us in this report why there are become the 2 most transportations.<br></p><p><b>﻿Most popular transport</b><br></p><p>Bike is the most popular transport that is very good for the students and ours environmental. Bike is good for environmental because it is no pollution and students can do exercise while they are traveling to University also they do not to worry about transportation fee. But bike also have disadvantages they have to be careful while they travel to University because it no bicycle lanes for ride and bike is very slow transport so students have to plan to travel early and after arrive they have to change their clothes.</p><p><b>﻿Second most popular transport</b></p><p>Train is the second most popular for the students because it is good for environment and also it very quick more than bike. Besides, train station is everywhere so it easy for the students to use the train. But the train ticket is very expensive and sometimes late or cancelled. Also when students need to go to University on rush hour, the train would be crowded.<br></p><p><b>﻿Recommendations</b><br></p><p>﻿For using Bike they need to have the bike lanes for safe places for the students and also they need to have changing room for the students after they arrived the University and also need a guideline for the students that they can bike safely. For the train suggest to start there lesson later to avoid rush hour or students have to come to University early.<b><br></b></p><p><br></p>",
