        "value": "<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>The aim of this report is to illustrate the information about two most used vehicles which are bike and train when it comes to benefits, drawbacks, and recommendations accordingly. Therefore, this essay is widely open for discussions and several opinions will be added.</p><p><b>Most Popular Transport</b></p><!--EndFragment--><p>For the advantages of bikes, it is undeniable that bikes are the most popular transportation that helps decrease the amount of carbon dioxide, especially in the main cities where there are lots of traffic and vehicles. In addition, many people often use bikes for exercising and also for shaping a good-looking body. Moreover, the price of bikes are mostly affordable by many citizens, so that makes bikes the most consumed transportation. On the other hand, the problems of bikes are that many of them were often reported as loss or stolen in the public because most people usually park bikes anywhere they want. Furthermore, bikes are not a suitable vehicle in some seasons like summer as well as in some situations that are urgent.</p><b>Second Most Popular Transport<br></b><p>The first advantage that the train is the second most popular means of transportation and is good for the environment. For example, it helps to reduce carbon dioxide because it can carry a lot of passengers at once a time. Apart from being good for the environment, another reason is quick because the train comes on time and you don't have to waste your time in traffic jams. Furthermore, many stations are locating in the place where they are reachable by a lot of passenger. However, price is not affordable when compared with service. Sometimes the train arrive too late or canceled. In addition, train are usually being crowded in the peak time like in the morning and evening because the employee start or finish their job and student finish their study.<b><br></b></p><p><b>Recommendations</b></p><p>For my recommendations of bikes, the government and related parties should increase the amount of CCTV in the public to help monitor in case of loss or theft. They could also make it even more extreme in terms of fines and punishment. Plus, they should create a specific way for bikes where there are none of the traffic lights to make bikers become more comfortable in traveling. For my recommendations of trains, According to the research, it show that student who got enough sleep hour (8-10 hours) tend to be more productive than student who often lack of sleep. So, the  government should start lessons after the peak period of transportation to avoid rush hour. Moreover, the National Rail should discount tickets price for student because they always use train to go to school and they don't have income to pay it. In addition, the National Rail should create an application to show the timetable of train. For example, the time when train arrived and which train canceled. People will be able to plan properly.<b><br></b></p>",
