        "value": "<p>The aim of the report is to introduce two most popular means of transportation used by students of the university, and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each mode of transport. This is in order to provide the university with some helpful recommendations on how to improve the transport options for students. </p><b>Most Popular Transport</b><p>The bike is now a common mode of transport and it is the most popular means of transportation. Students think it has three advantages. The first is that it is good for the environment, it doesn't pollute the air by emitting too much carbon dioxide like cars do. Cycling is also a healthy exercise that gives people a workout after a long day at work. Also it is cheap compared to other forms of transport.</p><p>But it also has disadvantages. It’s speed is slow and at the moment there are not many safe place to park bikes. Plus if it’s raining or at the end of a ride, people get wet or sweaty so they need to change clothes after.</p><p><b>Second Most Popular Transport</b><b><br></b></p><p>Train is the second most popular means of transportation. Like bikes, it also has benefits for the environment. But it's quicker than a bicycle or other means of transport. The station is also very close, so it's easy to take the train.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its many benefits, it costs a lot of money in expensive tickets. Sometimes for some reasons it can be late or cancelled. And in the rush hour, it can be very crowded.<b><br></b></p><p><b>Recommendation</b><br></p><p>To make the campus more accessible, here are a few recommendations. Firstly the university should find more secure areas to park bikes. Secondly there should be more changing rooms to make it easier for students to change after cycling. Also planning some separate bike lanes on campus would be a good way. For trains, the university can try to start lessons later to avoid rush hour.<b><br></b><br></p>",
