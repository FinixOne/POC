        "value": "<p>The aim of this report is to illustrate the benefit and drawback of the two types of transportation that students used the most to go to the university. Besides, my essay will analyze the suggestion for this concern.</p><p><br></p><p>The most popular transport is the bike which has a positive impact on the environment. In addition, it is cheap, convenient, and allows the students to go to the university by themselves effectively. Thus, they will have good health. However, it is clear to see that there is not a safe place for bikes on the university. Furthermore, students will be exhausted because their bike is slow and they need to change clothes after going back home.</p><p><br></p><p>The second most popular transport is the train. It is not only good for the environment but it is also quicker than the bike and station available near. But the possible drawback is that going by train sometimes is late or cancelled, especially in rush hour, the students feel uncomfortable beacause of the crowded train. The ticket for each trip is quite expensive and not suitable for students' budgets as well.</p><p><br></p><p>My recommendation to the university is that they should have the safe parking for the bike on the yard to protect the students' property. With the train, the studies should start lessons later to avoid rush hour. Beside, they should have the student discount from 10% to 30% or combine it with the student ID of university. As a result, it could facilitate students to go to the university by public transportation as train or bus</p>",
