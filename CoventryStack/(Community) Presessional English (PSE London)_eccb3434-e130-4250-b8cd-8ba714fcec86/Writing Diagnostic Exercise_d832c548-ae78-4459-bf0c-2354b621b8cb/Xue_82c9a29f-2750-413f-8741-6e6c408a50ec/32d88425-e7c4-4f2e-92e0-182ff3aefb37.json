        "value": "<p>The aim of this report is to introduce two most popular means of transportation used by students and that advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Students’ favorite way to travel is by bike.It is the most popular means of transportation.There are three advantages.Firstly,cycling is good for environment without any carbon emission.Secondly,it is good for our healthy. Cycling is exercise,you can lose weight and keep fit. Thirdly, cycling is cheap, you spend almost nothing.For example, if you go to school by bus, you will spend 2or3pounds.But if you ride bike, you can spend for nothing. However, there are some disadvantages.Firstly,There are not safe place for bike.So that many students lost their bikes or were damaged.Secondly,cycling is very slow. The same distance takes longer time. Thirdly, you need changed clothes after. This is not convenient for students. So there are two recommendations. The first the university should build safe place for bike.The second the university should build changing rooms for students.</p><p>Second most popular transport is train.There are three advantages.Firstly, it is good for environment.Trains can carry many people so these people can reduce travel of other transports, like bus and car.Secondly, train is very quick.Same distance you will save a lot of time and then you can safe time to do other things.Thirdly,the train station is near the university. It is very convenient for students.But there are some disadvantages,I think it should pay attention.First of all it is expensive to take the train.Many students do not have enough money to take trains because students do not have work to earn money. Secondly, the train sometimes late or cancelled.If you have important thing, you may be delayed. Thirdly, every rush hour, it will be crowed.The space becomes very small, you can not turn your body or move your body so this will make you very uncomfortable.So my advice is you can start lessons later to avoid rush hour.</p><p>These are the information I collected and my recommendations. I think this very useful for university.</p><p><br></p>",
