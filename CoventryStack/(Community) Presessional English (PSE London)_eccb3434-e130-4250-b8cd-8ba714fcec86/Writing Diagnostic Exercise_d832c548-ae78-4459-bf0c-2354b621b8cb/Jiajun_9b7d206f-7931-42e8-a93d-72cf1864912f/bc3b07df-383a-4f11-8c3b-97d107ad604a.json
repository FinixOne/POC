        "value": "<p><br>The aim of this report is to analyze these two transportation tools in order to serve students' travel.<br><br>The most popular means of transportation is bicycle. Its advantage are that it won't pollute the environment, .What’s more, as a means of exercise, riding a bike is  also very healthy — you burn 600 calories per hour!, Another advantage is that a bicycle is so cheap that college students can afford it. But there are also many disadvantages of bicycles, for example, there are no safe places for bikes to park. Bikes are easy to be stolen. And if you're in a hurry and the distance is long, you won't use a bike. Another thing is that you have to change your cycling cloth to  your dailycloth after every bike ride, which is very troublesome.<br><br>The second popular means of transport is the train. Trains are also good for the environment. And the speed of the train was very high ，often travelling long distances in a few hours. The train station is often built nearby your house so it only takes a short time to get there. But fast means train tickets will be a little more expensive. And trains are more easily to be late or canceled, . The train station is always full of people during rush hour, which makes people feel uncomfortable.<br><br>My suggestion is to build a place to park bikes in the university. It will be safer. A changing room can also be built for students to change clothes. However，if many students take trains, the university can start lessons later to avoid rush hour.<br><br></p>",
