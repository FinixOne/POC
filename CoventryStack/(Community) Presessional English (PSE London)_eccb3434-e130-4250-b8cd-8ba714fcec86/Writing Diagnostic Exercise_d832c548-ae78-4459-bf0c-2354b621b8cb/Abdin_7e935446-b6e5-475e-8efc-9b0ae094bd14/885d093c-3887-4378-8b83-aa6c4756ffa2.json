        "value": "<p><br></p><p>The aim of this report is to identify the advantages and disadvantages of riding bike among the students. </p><p>As we know, bike is a most popular, cheapest transport in the world and that is a reason students prefer to ride it. Although, riding a bike is a popular among the students but it has some drawbacks as lack of safe places to ride, being slow and getting tired. These three drawbacks will be explained in detail and given examples.</p><p>It is an undeniable fact, bike ways have not developed and extended yet, so this reason causes some accidents. Another minus side is being late to somewhere as can be known bikes are not speedy transportation to travel. For instance, nowadays human beings prefer to travel short distance by bike because travelling long distance is waste of the time. Third negative aspect is changing clothes after a travelling by bike. One of the best examples is riding bike cause to sweat, that is why the students changes their clothes after.</p><p>For solving some of such troubles every government must make some decisions. Building safe roads as well as changing rooms for bike drivers would be the best recommendation. Despite riding a bike has some disadvantages but it is also possible to say it has many benefits for the environment, health, as well as expenses. Bike is the better and more different than other transports to protect our environment. It also has benefit for health because riding a bike is a sport for human beings. The last advantage is being cheap for students and others to travel. </p><p>Second most popular transport is train, and it has also plus sides, and minus sides that will be explained in detail before I give my own recommendation. </p><p>In my opinion advantages of travelling by train is more than disadvantages. Because travelling by train is beneficial for environment, quick to travel and nowadays there are many train stations. It is good for environment because does not fume gas and it cause clear weather. It is possible to say there are many modern trains in our modern world that are very fast. </p><p>There are also three disadvantages of travelling by train because sometimes can be very expensive, late and crowded. Being crowded in the train stations can cause illnesses.</p><p>It would be best recommendation to develop train stations by government.</p><p><br></p>",
