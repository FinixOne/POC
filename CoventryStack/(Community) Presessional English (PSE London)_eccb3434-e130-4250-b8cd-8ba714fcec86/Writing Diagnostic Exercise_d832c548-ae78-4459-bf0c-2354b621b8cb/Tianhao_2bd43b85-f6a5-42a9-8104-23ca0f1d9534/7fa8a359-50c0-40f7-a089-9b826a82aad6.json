        "value": "<p>Introduction</p><p>The aim of this report is to introduce the two most popular transportation used by students.without doubt, the most popular means of <!--StartFragment-->transportation is bicycle,second <!--StartFragment-->popular means of <!--StartFragment-->transportation is train.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Most popular transport</p><p>As for the reason why bike became the most pupular transportation,here is the advantage as below,first of all, biking is good for environment,if people use private bike as mush as frequently as possible, air pollution will be reduced.beside that taking bike not only is a healthy lifestyle,but also is a good way to save money, it seems like, you don not have to pay extra costs for fuels or taxes.instead taking bike still has some disadvantage, for example, biking lane is so narrow, which means there is no safe place for bikes,in addition, if you take bike to have a long distance travel,obviously the bike speed is to slow and you have to change clothes when you finish the activity. </p><p>Second Most popular transport</p><!--EndFragment--><p>Train become the second most popular transport. as one of the public transportation,train is good for environment and it is so quick, it can save your time, make you working more effectively, beside that trains station is near. on the other hand trains still has some disadvantages, for instance, trains ticket is so expensive,especially during the rush hour, the whole trains carriage will get so crowded, but the most biggest issue is  taking trains sometimes or cancelled, it is so terrible for people who are in rush.</p><p>Recommendation</p><p>To sum up, for the bike issuse, i think it should be make more safe place for bikes and build more changing room for student.  my opinion is to provide more helmet for students to keep safe and make more space for biking lane ,as for the trains issue it can be start lessons late to avoid rush hour.</p>",
