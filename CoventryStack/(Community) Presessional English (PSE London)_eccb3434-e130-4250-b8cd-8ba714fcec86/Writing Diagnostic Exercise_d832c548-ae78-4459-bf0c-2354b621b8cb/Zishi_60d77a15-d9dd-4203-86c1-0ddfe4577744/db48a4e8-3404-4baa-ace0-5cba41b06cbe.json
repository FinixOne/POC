        "value": "<p><b>Introduction </b></p><p>The aims of this report is to analyze the pros and cons of the two popular transportation used by students. The two types of transportation in the table above are bike and train.<br></p><p><b>Most popular transport</b><br><br>Nowadays, more and more people are turning cycling into a new way of getting around. Bike is a low-carbon transportation and it's a good way to have a healthy body. Second, it's economical and cheap for students who are not rich. However, there are some drawbacks. For example, some places do not provide safe bicycle parking. As a result, some students' bikes will be lost, resulting in property damage. In terms of speed, It's not as fast as trains or cars and you are being late if you get up late in the morning. Finally, clothes may get dirty after cycling, so it's not convenient to ride a bike if there are important occasions.<br></p><p><b>second popular transport</b></p><p>﻿Some other students prefer to choose trains. It's also a low-carbon way to travel and it's good for the environment. Compare with the bicycle, it is faster, and there are stations close to the schools. which is convenient for students. On the other hands, for some students, the expensive tickets which they they cannot afford. Because of the weather sometimes rains will be delayed or even cancelled, it will be a big problem for students, absent is a serious problem at school. Lastly, during rush hour, the train will be crowded, which may lead to a safety problems.<b><br></b><br></p><p><b>Recommendations</b></p><p>In order to provide a better learning environment for students, it is hoped that the university can provide safe parking spaces and changing rooms and also can change the time of the class after the rush hour ends. My personal suggestion is that the school can provide students with some transportation expenses to facilitate students to choose their own transportation.<b><br></b></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
