        "value": "<p>discuss which means of transportation students use most often. And through big data statistics of the most popular means of transportation, to analyze their advantages and disadvantages. Finally put forward some suggestions.</p><p>Most Popular Transport</p><p>Bicycles have been very popular among students for a long time. For students, riding bicycles is a good way to do exercise. Then, relatively cheap, which can be easily affordable by most families. Secondly, students riding bike to school also protects the environment and reduces the emission of carbon dioxide.But the disadvantages are also obvious. First of all, bicycles have no road of their own, which is easy to be dangerous. Secondly, the speed of the bicycle is still very slow.If you want to go to some places, you need to set aside relatively rich time. Finally, cycling requires a change of clothes after the ride.</p><p>Second Most Popular Transport</p><p>Train is the most convenient means of transportation for people to go to distant places, and students is that most stations are very close to each school, which is very convenient for students to take.Secondly, the speed of train is very fast, and it can reach far places in a short time. I have to say that taking the train is also good for the environment.But the disadvantage is that the train ticket price is generally more expensive; And sometimes late or cancelled due to uncertain factors:During rush hour, the train can get very crowded.</p><p>Recommendations</p><p>Therefore,the suggestion I would like to make is this.In terms of bike, it is better to set up bike lanes for bike,which is convenient for students to ride and also ensures students' safety.Secondly, we can build rooms for students to change their clothes. Then enhance the safety awareness of students, in cycling to do focus, safety is the first.Later advice for those who take the train to school is to stare lesson late to avoid rush hour.Or students can plan ahead to take the earlier train ,and the earlier time can also arrive at school in advance to review the knowledge learned in class.</p>",
