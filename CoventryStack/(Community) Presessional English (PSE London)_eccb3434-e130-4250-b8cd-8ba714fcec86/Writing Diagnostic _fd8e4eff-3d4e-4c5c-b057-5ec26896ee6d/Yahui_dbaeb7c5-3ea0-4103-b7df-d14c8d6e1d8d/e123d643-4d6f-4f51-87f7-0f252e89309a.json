        "value": "<p>  The aim of this report is to illustrate that there are two popular ways of transportation used by students. I would state the advantages and disadvantages of both of them. </p><p>  The first popular transportation is bike. More and more students choose the bicycle as theri transpotation. The one of advantages of bicycle is good for environment.That means that we will caused less pollutions by taking the bicycle. Also, the other advatages of bicycle is healthy and cheap. Peaple could do the exercise when they take the bicycles. In the other hands, there are some disadvantages of bicycle. Firstly，there are no safe places for bikers. And, the bicycles is slower than other transportation. Then, the bikers need to change clothers before and after they take the bicycles. </p><p>   The second popular transportation is trian.  Train always is good choice not only for the students. The advantages of train is also good for envirnment. If everyone like to take the train, they would less drive theri own cars. Meanwhile, the trains are quick and each station is near by the other one. That is very convenient. However, the disadvantage of transportation is expensive tickets.  Some studetns cannot afford high price tickets. And sometimes, the rain is not on time. Also, the train is very crowded during the ruch hours. </p><p>   In conclusion, as I refered the disadvantages of two popular transportations, I  have some suggestions for that.  Firstly, I hope the governments could build more and more safe place for bikes and make them safe.  Meanwhile, the school could use one rooms for the students who take the bicycles so that they could change their clothers.  Secondly, school could start lessons later to avoid ruch hours. And students try to reconnect the trains.</p>",
