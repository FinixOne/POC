        "value": "<p> The aim of this report is to help students go to university and take classes more conveniently in the part of transportations. According to the survey, I analyze the two most popular means of  transportattion used by students, bike and train. First, I will discuss the advantage and disadvantage of two vehicles respectively and give my own recommendations to the university.</p><p>The most popular means of transportation is bike. For most of students, ,there are three main advantages to choose it. Firstly, in terms of environment, using bike can aviod air pollution and reduce carbon emissions. It’s more environmental than some motor vehicles likes car, bus and so on. Secondly, students can exercise while going to school by bike.It’s healthy for their bodies and save lots of extra exercise time to do other things. Thirdly, it’s also save much money on transportation. However, using bike have some nagetive effects for students. For example, it’s may hurt themselves if they fall by accident on street because of the unsafe area for bike. And the speed of bike is lower than many other vehicles. On the other hand,the trouble thing is they need to change clothes before taking classes.&nbsp;</p><p>Second most popular means of is train. According to the results, students choose train for three reasons. Firstly, it is similar to bike that is good for environment. Secondly, comparing with bike, .it’s faster then it ,they don’t need much time on the way. In addition, the most convenient that the station is near. Meanwhile, there also have some disadvantages one of them is expensive price which is opposite to bike, perhaps some of students can not afford charge of tickets if they will by train everyday. And sometimes the train will be late or cancelled because of bad weather and other accidents. The most serious situation is students must face to rush hour every workday morning. It’s possibly cause missed class time for them.</p><p>Combining the demands of students using both means of transportation,I give some my own suggestions to university that can improve their campus life. Firstly,we need build a safety area for bike immediately. It is can guarantee the safe of students who will go to university by bike. And we need to provide a changing room for students at the same time. Secondly, we should change our start lesson time，such as postpone the time after rush hour or cancelled the class of that period. Tirdly，maybe we can help some of poor student to afford the part of their charge of ticket or give them some student discount of trian. Finally，I think we can set up a special route from their homes to university and offer students the free school bus for students who are not suitable to take other means of transportations,it is can solve the convenient problem,funding problem and others. The transportation way of students is vitally important so we need to pay more attention on it. <br></p>",
