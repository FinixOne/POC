However , there are pros and cons in deciding to do this . In this essay I will discuss some of the benefits and drawbacks and try to come to a conclusion .&nbsp;</p><p>I will start by looking at the advantages . For me , one of major plus points of using a bike as your main transportation is that it is known as an effective way to improve physical health and reduce  the risk of obesity. Secondly , bicycles are the most useful form of transport to combat against traffic gridlock as well as environment damages. In addition, it does not need gasoline , which means that it is cheaper than any knowns transportation.  </p><p>Turning to the other side of the argument, it is undeniable that many people argued that riding is uncomfortable for them. They allay that they have to change clothes after riding a bike. Besides, bicycle are not a good choice as a reliable mode of transport when the weather is adverse. Another issue is that bicycle is much slower that bus or train.  <br></p><p>In conclusion, it seems to me that on the whole the advantages go cycling on modern people are much weightier than the drawbacks based on a wide range of benefits they offer.</p><p><br></p><p>                                                      </p>",
